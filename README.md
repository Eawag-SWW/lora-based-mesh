## Synopsis
Although emerging low-power wireless communication techniques allow efficient data transfers with great above-ground performance, for underground or indoor applications a large coverage range is difficult to achieve due to physical and topological limitations. This repo provides detailed information on a novel LPWAN concept that i) enhances transmission reliability, efficiency and flexibility in range-critical situations through meshed multi-hop routing, and ii) ensures a precise time-synchronization through optional GPS or DCF77 long-wave time signaling.
